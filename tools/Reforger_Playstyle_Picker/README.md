# Arma Reforger – Small Team Playstyle Picker 🎲

## Overview
This is a lightweight **offline HTML/JS tool** to help 2–4 person squads in *Arma Reforger* quickly pick **playstyles** when starting a session.  

Instead of always defaulting to the same tactics, the picker rolls for:
- **Two random categories** (Infantry, Sabotage, Support, Vehicles)  
- **1–3 random sub-styles** per category  

This adds variety, forces adaptation, and makes small-team gameplay more engaging.
