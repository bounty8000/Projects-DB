# Division Network Architecture (Signal CCC Group Compilation)

## Overview
This PowerPoint presentation documents a **division-level network architecture** that was developed and refined as part of coursework in the U.S. Army Signal Captains Career Course (CCC).  

The architecture is built around real-world doctrinal concepts, integrating tactical communications, mission command systems, and supporting infrastructure. It was designed to reflect how a division headquarters would employ its signal assets to enable secure and reliable communications across subordinate brigades, echelons above brigade (EAB), and joint partners.
