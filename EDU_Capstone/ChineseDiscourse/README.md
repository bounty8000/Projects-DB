# Chinese Discourse Capstone – USMA Projects Day 2021

This repository contains materials related to my team's capstone project presented at the **United States Military Academy’s Department of Foreign Languages** during **Projects Day**, delivered in Chinese on **29 April 2021**.

## Project Title
**Interpreting the Use of Liberal-democratic Terms in Chinese Communist Party Discourse from 1978-2017**

## Research Question

> **How does the Chinese Communist Party use terms related to digital democracy in its discourse to accomplish domestic and foreign political purposes, and why is it critical to understand its usage?**

## Project Overview

This capstone investigates the CCP’s use of specific politically charged terms—such as:

- 民主 (*democracy*)
- 环境保护 (*environmental protection*)
- 自由 (*freedom*)
- 发展 (*development*)
- 权利 (*rights*)

The research analyzes how these terms are employed in **official statements, state-run media, policy publications, and public-facing narratives** to shape perceptions, influence domestic legitimacy, and assert soft power on the global stage.

### Key methods included:
- **Selection of core terms of interest**
- **Corpus construction** using Chinese-language government and media sources
- **Discourse analysis** based on frequency, usage context, audience targeting, and correlation with key events and policy initiatives

The project identifies patterns in linguistic framing across different communication channels and highlights how semantic control plays a central role in China's domestic governance and international diplomacy.
