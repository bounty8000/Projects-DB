# Useful Files & Technical Notes – [Tony]

This repository contains a collection of IT related files, diagrams, and documentation that I've either created or found helpful throughout my work and study. It serves as a reference hub and personal knowledge base as I continue developing professionally in the communications and technical space.

## Purpose

This repo is intended to be a practical reference/showcase. Some items are polished; others are mid-development. Items here reflects something I’ve either built, tested, or found useful in my own study or practice.

Feel free to explore, fork, or reference anything useful.
